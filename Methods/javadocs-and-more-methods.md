# Javadocs and More Methods

Javadoc is all about commenting your code correctly. Javadoc is both the tool and the style of commenting your Java programs. Commenting is very important, as it provides notes in our code to help others understand it.


## Javadoc Rules

Javadoc comments are similar to multiline comments, but contain an extra `*`. Here is an example of how Javadoc comments start and end:

``` Java
/**
 * Here is an example of a Javadoc Comment
 */
```

## More Examples

Here are some examples of proper Javadoc comments:

``` Java
 /**
  * This method returns the product of two integers.
  *
  * @param numOne The first integer
  * @param numTwo The second integer
  * @return The product of the two integers
  */
 private int product(int numOne, int numTwo)
 {
    return numOne * numTwo;
 }
 
 /**
  *
  *
  *
  *
  */
  private String[] split(string input)
  {
    return input.split("\\s+");
  }
```
