# Javadocs and More Methods

Javadoc is all about commenting your code correctly. Javadoc is both a tool and the style of commenting your Java programs. Commenting is important as it provides notes in our code to help others understand it.


## Javadoc Rules

Javadoc comments are similar to multiline comments, but contain an extra `*`. Here is an example of a Javadoc comment and its structure:

``` Java
/**
 * Description of method
 *
 * @param paramName1  description
 * @param paramName2  description
 * return  Description of return value
 */
```

## More Examples

Here are some examples of proper Javadoc comments:

``` Java
 /**
  * This method returns the product of two integers.
  *
  * @param numOne  The first integer
  * @param numTwo  The second integer
  * @return  The product of the two integers
  */
 private int product(int numOne, int numTwo)
 {
    return numOne * numTwo;
 }
 
 /**
  * This method returns an array with each word from a string in it.
  *
  * @param input  The string we want to split.
  * @return  The new string array.
  */
  private String[] split(string input)
  {
    return input.split("\\s+");
  }
```
