# Strings and Characters
Let's review some key differences between Strings and characters:

| Strings | characters |
| -- | -- |
| Type: String | Type: char |
| Object | primitive |
| Compare using the `.equals()` method| Compare using `==` |
| Surrounded by double quotes (Example: "hello") | Surrounded by single quotes (Example: 'a') |
| Sequence of characters (Example: "hello") | A single character (Example: 'a')|

Here is an example of declaring a String in Java:
```
String website = "CodeHS";
```
And here is an example of declaring a character in Java:
```
char letter = 'b';
```

Let's break apart these two examples into their individual components:
