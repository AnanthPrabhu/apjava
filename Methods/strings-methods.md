# Strings Methods

You will remember that Strings are a sequence of characters. Take the example String below:

```
String str = "Hello World"
```

Here is another way to think about Strings as a sequence of characters:

| 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| H  | e  | l  | l  | o  |    | W  | o  | r  | l  | d  |

Each character in this string has a position. The first character 'H'a position of 0. The second You will note that the space between the two words is at position 5.
