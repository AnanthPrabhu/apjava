# Commenting Your Code

There are two parts to writing a program: One part is getting it to work (the functionality). The other part is the style: How did you write the program? Did you break it down into parts? Is it clear to read? 

This is where comments come into play!

## Introducing comments

Comments are a way for you to leave notes about what your code is doing in plain English so that other people can understand it. 

### Why comment?

Even though code is run by computers, it is read by other people. Comments help others understand your code.
