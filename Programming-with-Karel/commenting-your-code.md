# Commenting Your Code

There are two parts to writing a program: One part is getting it to work (the functionality). The other part is the style: How did you write the program? Did you break it down into parts? Is it clear to read? 

This is where comments come into play!

## Introducing comments

Comments are a way for you to leave notes about what your code is doing in plain English so that other people can understand it. 

### Why comment?

Even though code is run by computers, it is read by other people. Comments help others understand your code. If you read your code ten years from now, would you be able to understand what it does? 

### Multi-line comments

Use multi-line comments to leave a comment so a reader understands what your program or method is doing.
