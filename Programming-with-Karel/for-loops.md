# For Loops

We've seen how to give Karel instructions, but so far we've given each command one at a time.  But what if we want Karel to move 40 times?  Or what if we want Karel to put down 135 balls in one spot?  Do we really have to type ```putBall()``` 135 times?  The good news is no we don't!

### Why For Loops?
For loops let us type a series of commands only  once, then let the program tell Karel to do it multiple times. It is important to note that for loops are used when we want a fixed number of repetitions.
