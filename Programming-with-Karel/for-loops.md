# For Loops

We've seen how to give Karel instructions, but so far we've given each command one at a time.  But what if we want Karel to move 40 times?  Or what if we want Karel to put down 135 balls in one spot?  Do we really have to type ```putBall()``` 135 times?  The good news is no we don't!

### Why For Loops?
For loops let us type a series of commands only  once, then let the program tell Karel to do it multiple times. It is important to note that for loops are used when we want a fixed number of repetitions. For example, we could use a for loop if we want to move 10 spaces or put down 150 balls.  In both of these cases, we have a fixed number of times we want a specific set of instructions to be executed.

### Using For Loops
The syntax of a for loop is as follows:

```for(initialize; condition; update){``` 
        </br> // code goes here    
    }
```
