# How to Indent Your Code

Indentations are an important part of the structure of your code that make it easier to read and understand.

## Indenting Your Code

A general rule for Java is to ***always*** place brackets on their own lines, and indent the code within the brackets. Here is an example for you to reference:

```
// Notice how the brackets are on new lines and the code within is indented.
public void run()
{  
    move();
    turnLeft();
    move();
}
```


You apply the same rule for indentations when using nested control structures. Consider this example:

```
// Notice how the brackets are on new lines and the code within is indented.
public void run() 
{
    while(ballsPresent())
    {
        if(frontIsClear())
        {
            move();
        }
    }
}
```


## Practice Questions

**1)** Consider the following piece of code:
```
public class WalkRoadKarel extends SuperKarel
{
public void run()
{
    while(frontIsClear())
    {
        move();
    }
}
}
```
<p> Does this piece of code have proper indentations? </p>
- [ ] Yes
- [x] No
 
> Very close! Remember, we want to indent everything within the brackets. Everything within your class's brackets is missing an indentation.

> This is the correct answer! Nice job!




**2)** Consider the following piece of code:
```
public classCleanRoad extends SuperKarel
{
    public void run()
    {
        while(frontIsClear())
        {
            if(ballsPresent())
            {
                takeBall();
            }
            move();
        }
    }
}
```
<p> Does this piece of code have proper indentations? </p>
- [x] Yes
- [ ] No
 
> This is the correct answer! Nice job!

> Almost! This piece of does have proper indentations, because each bracket has it's own line and every piece of code within the brackets has an indentation.
