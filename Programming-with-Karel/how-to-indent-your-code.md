# How to Indent Your Code
Indentations are an important part of the structure of your code. Indentations make your code easier for other people to read and understand, and are a key part of good style.

## Indenting Your Code

A general rule for Java is to ***always*** place brackets on their own lines, and indent the code within the brackets. Here is an example for you to reference:

```
// Notice how the brackets are on new lines and the code within is indented.
public void run()
{  
    move();
    turnLeft();
    move();
}```
