# While Loops in Karel

Lets say Karel is standing on one side of the world, and we want to move to the next side. Up to this point the best way would be to write a for loop that repeats the ```move();``` command a set number of times. What if we don't know the size of Karel's world? In this case we would use a while loop, which iterates a command while a condition is true. 

## Basics of While Loops

While loops, unlike for loops, execute the target statement as long as the condition is true.

Consider at the following situations:
 - While a vehicle is running it uses gas. 
 - When the vehicle is turned off, it will no longer use gas.
 

Another example of while loops can be seen in Karel's world:
