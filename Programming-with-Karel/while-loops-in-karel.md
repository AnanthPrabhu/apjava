# While Loops in Karel

Lets say Karel is standing on one side of the world, and we want to move to the next side. Up to this point the best way would be to write a for loop that repeats the move(); command a set number of times. What if we don't know the size of Karel's world? In this case we would use a while loop, which iterates a command while a condition is true.
