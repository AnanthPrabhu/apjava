# Methods in Karel

In the last chapter, we briefly introduced using a method to turn Karel right. But what is a method? And why would we want to use them?


## The Basics

A method is a way to teach Karel a new word, or a new command. Methods allow us to break our program down into smaller parts and make it easier to understand. A program with many smaller methods is easier to read and fix than a program with one very large method.

The format of a method looks like:

    private void myMethod()
    {
        /* code goes here */
    }
    
## Naming is crucial

Here is another example: 

    private void buildPyramid()
    {
        /* code goes here */
    }

From the name of our method, ```buildPyramid()```, it is very clear what the method does. There are a few rules for how you name your methods: 
* Method name should start with a letter, and cannot have any spaces.
* Every new word in the name starts with an uppercase letter.
* The name should describe *what* this function does.
* The name should start with an action verb, and sound like a command.

<p>Which of the following are good method names?</p>
- [x] buildTower()
- [ ] tower()
- [ ] build tower()
- [ ] 5moves()
- [x] spinTwice()
- [ ] blahblah()

> Good! The method name describes what it does, is in Camel Case, and does not have any illegal characters.
>
> Bad! The method name is not an action/command.
>
> Bad! The method name should not have spaces between words. 
>
> Bad! The method name should not start with a number. 
>
> Good! The method name describes what it does, is in Camel Case, and does not have any illegal characters.
>
> Bad! The method name is not descriptive.

## Defining a method vs. calling a method

When we want to create and use new methods, there are two parts: Defining a method and calling our method after we have defined it. 

**Defining a method:** Teaching Karel the new word. In other words, writing out the instructions for this new action.

**Calling a method for Karel:** Actually getting Karel to do the command. Actually causing the action to happen.


### Example

**Defining ```turnRight()```**: Karel, when you want to turn right, the instructions are to turn left three times.

**Calling ```turnRight()```**: Karel, turn right.

## Example: Defining ```turnAround()```

Let's teach Karel how to turn around. Here is our class in a code editor: 

    public class TurnAroundKarel extends Karel{
        
        public void run()
        {
            move();
        }
        
    }

If we try and call turnAround()
