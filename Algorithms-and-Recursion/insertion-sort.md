# Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is another sorting algorithm that we can use to sort arrays. Going back to the statistics package example discussed in the previous chapter. We can use Insertion Sort to sort our array of integers so we can find the median value. 


##### How it works
As with Selection Sort; Insertion Sort uses loops to iterate over the array. The difference in Insertion Sort is that as we iterate over the array, we will put each element in its designated position. Where as Selection Sort will search for the smallest element on each iteration.
