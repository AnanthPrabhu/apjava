# 2D Arrays (Matrices or Grids)
<hr>
Lets say we are contracted by a video game company to build Tic-Tac-Toe game. We need to figure out a method of storing each player's turn to a grid. How would we achieve this? Luckily, Java allows us to utilize 2-Dimensional Arrays or Grids. A 2D Array can best be described as an "array of arrays."
<br>

### Creating 2D Arrays
<hr>
To create a 2D Array, we would declare it in a similar fashion as a regular Array. A 2D Array's declaration would look like: ``type[][] name = new type[rows][columns];``

Here are some examples:

```Java
// Create a 2x4 grid of doubles
double[][] doubleGrid = new double[2][4];
 
// Create a 5x6 grid of Strings
String[][] stringGrid = new String[5][6];

// Create a 6x10 grid of chars
char[][] charGrid = new char[6][10];

// Create a 3x3 grid of integers
int[][] intGrid = new int[3][3];

// Initializing our Tic-Tac-Toe Grid with X's (1's) as the winner.
int[][] gameBoard = {
  {1, 0, 2},
  {0, 1, 2},
  {0, 0, 1}
 };
```
<br>

### What 2D Arrays Look Like
<hr>
If you were to visualize a 2D Array, it would be easiest to think of it like a table of values:

Here is what a 3x3 2D Array would look like:

|   | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 0 |$$(0, 0)$$|$$(1, 0)$$|$$(2, 0)$$|
| 1 |$$(0, 1)$$|$$(1, 1)$$|$$(2, 1)$$|
| 2 |$$(0, 2)$$|$$(1, 2)$$|$$(2, 2)$$|
Where the top and far left rows represent our **X** and **Y** indexes. 

### Utilizing 2D Arrays
<hr>
Now that we understand what 2D Arrays look like, and how to create them, we can focus on utilization. 

Now, lets say we have a 3x3 grid, named `gameBoard`, with the value of our Tic-Tac-Toe game. In this case, `0` represents a blank space, `1` represents a **X**, and `2` represents an **O**.

Here is what our grid looks like with **X** as the winner:

|   | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **0** | 1 | 0 | 2 |
| **1** | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| **2** | 2 | 2 | 1 |

##### Getting an Element:
Lets say we want to access a specific element of our grid. For this, we use: `int elem = grid[row][col];`
<br>
<br>
With that said, we want to grab the element in the middle of the grid. So we would use: `int elem = gameBoard[1][1];`, which would give us a `1`.
<br>
<br>
Now, lets say we want to get the element in the top right corner of the canvas. In this case, we use `int elem = gameBoard[2][0];` and we get `2`.
<br>

##### Setting an Element:
In order to set an element of a grid we use `grid[row][col] = elem;`
<br>
<br>
If we were to want to make **O** the winner of our game we would have to set the elements at $$(0, 0)$$ and $$(0, 1)$$ to `2`. In order to do this we would use:
```Java
gameBoard[0][0] = 2;
gameBoard[0][1] = 2;
```

Now our Grid looks like:

|   | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **0** | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| **1** | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| **2** | 2 | 2 | 1 |
<br>
##### Getting a Row:
