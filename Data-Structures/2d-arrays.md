# 2D Arrays (Matrices or Grids)
<hr>
Lets say we are contracted by a video game company to build Tic-Tac-Toe game. We need to figure out a method of storing each player's turn to a grid. How would we achieve this? Luckily, Java allows us to utilize 2-Dimensional Arrays or Grids. A 2D Array can best be described as an "array of arrays."

```Java
int[][] arr
```
