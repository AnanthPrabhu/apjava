# Arrays vs ArrayLists
<hr>
Both Arrays and ArrayLists are incredibly useful to programmers, but how do we know when to use them? While both Arrays and ArrayLists perform similar operations, they are used differently.

### Differences Between Arrays and ArrayLists
<hr>
The biggest difference between an Array and ArrayList is expandability. While the size of an ArrayList can change, an Array is a set size. Other differences include how both handle types, getting the size/length, and various helper method.

How we retrieve the size or length of an Array or ArrayList varies between the two.

With ***ArrayLists*** we would use ``list.size()``.

##### Setting Values at Index:
Settings values at a given index varies as well.
