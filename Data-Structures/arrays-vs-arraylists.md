# Arrays vs ArrayLists
<hr>
Both Arrays and ArrayLists are incredibly useful to programmers, but how do we know when to use them? While both Arrays and ArrayLists perform similar operations, they are used differently.

### Differences Between Arrays and ArrayLists
<hr>
The biggest difference between an Array and ArrayList is expandability. While the size of an ArrayList can change, an Array is a set size. Other differences include how both handle types, getting the size/length, and various helper method.

##### Getting the Size or Length:
How we retrieve the size or length of an Array or ArrayList varies between the two.
<br>
When dealing with an ***Array*** we use ``arr.length`` to access its length.
<br>
With ***ArrayLists*** we would use ``list.size()``.

##### Setting Values at an Index:
Settings values at a given index varies as well.
<br>
To set the value of a given index using an ***Array*** we use ``arr[i] = x;``
<br>
To set the value of a given index using an ***ArrayList*** we use ``list.set(i, x);``

##### Getting Values at an Index:
To retrieve values at a given index is as follows:
<br>

<br>

##### Creating New Instances:
To create new instances of an Array or ArrayList you use:
<br>

<br>

##### Extra Helper Methods:
Only ArrayLists have extra helper methods. These helper methods include:

##### Types:
