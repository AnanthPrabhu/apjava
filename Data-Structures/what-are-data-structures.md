# What Are Data Structures?

Data is the name for the symbols or quantities on which a program operates. There are many types of data and many ways to use data in programs. For example, if you are interested in weather patterns, you would want to collect temperature readings every day for several years. Or if you are working on a book of knock-knock jokes, you'd need to find as many knock-knock jokes as possible.

However, data isn't of much use on its own. Without programs to interpret them, data would just be a pile of symbols, numbers, and other characters. Programmers write code that takes in and processes data to make sense of the collected information. Because data is intended for use in programs and analysis, it needs to be organized. Hearkening back to the temperature collecting example, the data wouldn't be very useful if you wrote down a bunch of scattered numbers on one page and wrote the dates and times in a different order spread across other pages. Disorganized data is difficult for both computers and humans to understand.

## Introducing Data Structures

Data structures are particular ways of organizing data in programs. Just as there are many different types of data, there are many different types of data structures. We will cover a few of the most important data structures in this course: arrays, ArrayList, 2D arrays, and HashMaps.

#### Array
For example, imagine that you need to buy exactly 10 items at the grocery store. Rather than trying to remember every item to purchase, you find a piece of paper that is just big enough to write down a list of these 10 items and bring that list with you to the store. This type of data structure is called a list or *array*.

#### ArrayList
But what if your friend calls you on the way to the store and asks you to purchase a few items for her? Recall that the array has a fixed size, since the piece of paper you used to write it down on was only big enough for 10 items. In this case, you would want to use a list that would let you add and remove items as you go. This kind of flexible list is called an *ArrayList*.
