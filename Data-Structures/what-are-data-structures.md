# What Are Data Structures?

Data is the name for the symbols or quantities on which a program operates. There are many types of data and many ways to use data in programs. For example, if you are interested in weather patterns, you would want to collect temperature readings every day for several years. Or if you are working on a book of knock-knock jokes, you'd need to find as many knock-knock jokes as possible.

However, data isn't of much use on its own. Without programs to interpret them, data would just be a pile of symbols, numbers, and other characters. Programmers write code that takes in and processes data to make sense of the collected information. Because data is intended for use in programs and analysis, it needs to be organized. Hearkening back to the temperature collecting example, the data wouldn't be very useful if you wrote down a bunch of scattered numbers on one page and wrote the dates and times in a different order spread across other pages. Disorganized data is difficult for both computers and humans to understand.

## Introducing Data Structures

Data structures are particular ways of organizing data in programs.
