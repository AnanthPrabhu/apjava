# Arithmetic Expressions
Arithmetic Expressions allow us to perform mathematical operations within Java. 

These operations can span from being a basic counter, to a fully functional calculator.

# Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description|
| -- | -- |
| + | Addition operator (Ex. 1 + 1 = 2) |
| - | Subtraction operator (Ex. 2 - 1 = 1) |
| * | Multiplication operator (Ex. 2 * 2 = 4) |
| / | Division operator (Ex. 6 / 2 = 3) |
| % | Modulus operator (Ex. 10 % 3 = 1) |


##### Addition Operator

The addition operator allows us to add values together. These values can include hard coded numbers, or even variables.

Here is an example of the addition operator in a piece of Java code:
