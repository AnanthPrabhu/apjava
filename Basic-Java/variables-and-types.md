# Variables and Types

Variables are objects that hold a value which can be constant or changing. Variables allow us to store information such as numbers, words, or Boolean expressions. 

## Types and Variables

In Java we must specify what value we want our variables to hold. This is known as giving a variable a type. 

Here are some of the primitive types found in Java:

| Type | Description | Assignment |
| -- | -- | -- |
| int | integer | ``int`` |
| double | decimal numbers | ``double`` |
| char | characters | ``char``  |
| boolean | true/false value | ``boolean`` |


### Numeric Type
## 

Primitive Numeric Types in Java include both integer and double types. 

**Integers** are whole numbers, or counting numbers. 
(Ex. -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

In Java we declare an integer using ``int`` before the variable name. Here are a couple of examples: 

`` int itemsInStore = 10; ``

`` int costOfShoes = 80; ``
