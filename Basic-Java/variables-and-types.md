# Variables and Types

Variables are objects that hold a value which can be constant or changing. Variables allow us to store information such as numbers, words, or Boolean expressions. 

## Types and Variables

In Java we must specify what value we want our variables to hold. This is known as giving a variable a type. 

Here are some of the primitive types found in Java:

| Type | Description | Assignment |
| -- | -- | -- |
| int | integer | ``int`` |
| double | decimal numbers | ``double`` |
| char | characters | ``char``  |
| boolean | true/false value | ``boolean`` |


### Numeric Type
## 

Primitive Numeric Types in Java include both integer and double types. 

**Integers** are whole numbers, or counting numbers. 
(Ex. -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

In Java we declare an integer using ``int`` before the variable name. Here are a couple of examples: 

`` int itemsInStore = 10; ``

`` int costOfShoes = 80; ``

**doubles** are like integers, but can have decimals. (Ex. -54.34, 90.21, 0.1223)

In Java we declare a double using ``double`` before the variable name. Here are a couple of examples:

``double costOfApple = 1.24;``

``double milesRan = 5.64;``



### Char Type
## 

**Characters** represent a single character.

In Java we declare a character using ``char`` before the variable name. Here are a couple of examples:

``char currentGrade = 'A';``

``char favoriteLetter = 'W';``
