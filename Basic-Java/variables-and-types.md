# Variables and Types

Variables are objects that hold a value which can be constant or changing. Variables allow us to store information such as numbers, words, or Boolean expressions. 

## Types and Variables

In Java we must specify what value we want our variables to hold. This is known as giving a variable a type. 

Here are some of the primitive types found in Java:

| int | integer | 2:0 |
| -- | -- | -- |
| double | decimal numbers | ``double`` |
| char | characters |  |
| boolean | true/false value | 2:4 |
