# Variables and Types

Variables are objects that hold a value which can be constant or changing. Variables allow us to store information such as numbers, words, or Boolean expressions. 

## Types and Variables

In Java we must specify what value we want our variables to hold. This is known as giving a variable a type. 

Here are some common types found in Java:

| 0:0 | 1:0 | 2:0 |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 0:2 | 1:2 | 2:2 |
| 0:3 | 1:3 | 2:3 |
| 0:4 | 1:4 | 2:4 |
