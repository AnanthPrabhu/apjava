# Variables and Types

Variables allow us to store information such as numbers, words, or true/false expressions. A variable can be thought of as a box that stores information inside. In Java, variables are composed of three things: a name, type, and value. 

## Primitive Types

In Java we must specify what ***type*** of information we want our variables to hold. You must always give your variable a type before naming it, and specifying the value it holds. (Ex. ``
int myVariable = 10; ``)

Here are some of the primitive types found in Java:

| Type | Description | Assignment |
| -- | -- | -- |
| int | integer | ``int`` |
| double | decimal numbers | ``double`` |
| char | characters | ``char``  |
| boolean | true/false value | ``boolean`` |

## 
#### Numeric Type:
---

Primitive Numeric Types in Java include both integer and double types. 

**Integers** are whole numbers, or counting numbers. 
(Ex. -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

In Java we declare an integer using ``int`` before the variable name. Here are a couple of examples: 

```java
int itemsInStore = 10; 

int costOfShoes = 80;
```

**doubles** are like integers, but can have decimals. (Ex. -54.34, 90.21, 0.1223)

In Java we declare a double using ``double`` before the variable name. Here are a couple of examples:

```java
double costOfApple = 1.24;

double milesRan = 5.64;
```


## 
#### Char Type:
---

**Characters** represent a single character.

In Java we declare a character using ``char`` before the variable name. Here are a couple of examples:

```java
char currentGrade = 'A';

char favoriteLetter = 'W';
```

## 
#### Boolean Type:
---

**Booleans** are variables that hold a true or a false value.

In Java we declare a boolean using ``boolean`` before the variable name. Here are a couple of examples:

```java
boolean passedCalculus = true;

boolean hasDog = false;
```

## 
#### String Type:
---

**Strings** are variables that hold text. Strings are **not** a primitive type, so you must declare them using ``String`` with a capital **S**. Here are a couple of examples:

```java
String fishName = "Dog";

String myUniversity = "Arizona State University";
```

## Naming Variables

Giving your variables meaningful names throughout your code is very important. Proper variable names allow others to easily read and understand your code.
Variable names should be as descriptive as possible without being too long.

Variable Naming Conventions:

- Variable names must start with a letter, ``$`` symbol, or ``_`` symbol.

- Variable names are case sensitive so ``myVariable`` is different than ``MyVariable``

- Variable names, after the first character, can contain letters, numbers, or other characters.


Here are some examples of good variable names:

| Good: | Bad: |
| -- | -- |
| ``string myName;`` | ```string 8names;``` <dd>``// Starts with a number.`` |
| ``int numItems;`` | ``int num Items;`` <dd>``// Has a space between words.`` |
| ``char myGrade;`` | ``char b;`` <dd>``// Isn't descriptive enough.`` |
| ``double totalCost;`` | ``double TotalCost;`` <dd>``// Doesn't utilize lowerCamelCase``    |
