# While Loops

While loops are a way to repeat a block of code.  The basic syntax of a while loop is shown below.

``` 
while(condition)
{
    // code block to be done if condition is true
}

// code executed if condition is false
```

## While Loop or For Loop?

How do you decide whether to use a while loop or a for loop? We use for loops to repeat code a **fixed** number of times. We use while loops when we don't know how many times we will need to repeat some given code.
