# Casting

Casting allows us to change a variable's type to better suit our needs. 

## How Casting Works

Lets say we want to turn a double into an integer, or an integer into a double.

To change a variable's type we just add the type in between parentheses to cast it. 

Consider the following:

``` Java
int doubleToInt = (int)10.95;
double intToDouble = (double)5;
```
