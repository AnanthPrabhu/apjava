# Casting

Casting allows us to change a variable's type to better suit our needs. 

## How Casting Works

Lets say we want to turn a double into an integer, or an integer into a double.

To change a variable's type we just add the type in between parentheses to cast it. 

Consider the following:

``` Java
int doubleToInt = (int)10.95;
double intToDouble = (double)5;
```

##### Casting an Integer to a Double

To cast an integer value to a double, we add ``(double)`` in front of the variable.

``` Java
int intVal = 10;

double doubleVal = (double)intVal; // Our value is now '10.0'
```
##### Casting a Double to an Integer
