# Inheritance

***Inheritance*** is when we have two classes that share functionality. You use ***inheritance*** when you want to create a new class, but utilize existing code from another class. In this case, you derive your new class from the existing class. By doing this, you can utilize methods from the existing class without having to rewrite code.

### Class Hierarchy
***Class hierarchy*** is the inheritance relationship between your classes. ***Class hierarchy*** is also known as an inheritance tree. It is important to know that the ***root class*** in our hierarchy is the ***Object Class***. The ***Object Class*** contains many useful methods, such as: `clone()`, `equals()`, `toString()`, `finalize()`, and a few others. The further away from the ***root class*** we go the more exclusive the class behavior is.

Here is an example of an inheritance tree:

!["Inheritance Tree"](../static/classesAndOOP/Class_and _oop_Inheritance_Tree.png)

As you can see, we start off with our ***root class***, move to *Vehicle Class* and from there we get more defined as we go down the tree. Whenever we pass a method through our class it will travel up the inheritance tree until a suitable definition is found. Lets say we start in the *Truck* class, and call `toString()`. The `toString()` message will be sent up the tree until it gets to the *Object Class*. Once it gets to the *Object Class* a `toString()` method is found and utilized.

### Subclass and Superclass
The ***Subclass*** is the class the extends another class, or inherits from another class.
 
The ***Superclass*** is the class being utilized by the ***subclass***.

It is important to know that the ***subclass*** inherits everything from the ***super class***. This includes: classes, methods, and fields. 

#### Important Key Words
##### Extends
In order to show that a class relates to another, we use the **extends** keyword. Here is an example of a class that extends the **ConsoleProgram** class:

```Java
public class Output extends ConsoleProgram
{
    // code here
}
``` 
In this example `Output` is our ***subclass***, and `ConsoleProgram` is the ***superclass***.

##### Super
We can call the constructor of our superclass directly from our subclass by using the key work **super**.

Here we have a class which extends our ***Rectangle*** class. We use ***super*** to call the constructor of ***Rectangle*** to create a square.
```Java
public class Square extends Rectangle
{
    public Square(int sideLength)
    {
         super(sideLength, sideLength);
    }
}

```

### Subclass Functionality

There are many things we can do from our subclass since it inherits the private and public members of the parent class. 

It is important to remember:

- Subclasses inherit all of the public and protected instance methods of the parent class.
- Subclasses inherit all of the public and protected instance and class variables.
- Subclasses can have their own instance variables.
- Subclasses can have their own static and instance methods.
- Subclasses can override the parent class's methods.
- Subclasses can contain constructors that directly invoke the parent class's constructor using the `super` keyword.

### Example of Inheritance

Here is an example of inheritance utilizing our ***Rectangle*** and ***Sqaure*** classes.

***Superclass:***
```Java
public class Rectangle
{
     int width;
     int height;
     
     public Rectangle(int rwidth, int rheight)
     {
          width = rwidth;
          height = rheight;
     }
     
     public int getArea()
     {
          return width * height;
     }
}
```

***Subclass:***
```Java
public class Square extends Rectangle
{
     // Class constructor
     public Square(int sideLength)
     {
          // Call the class constructor for `Rectangle` using `super`
          super(sideLength, sideLength);
     }
}
```


***Test Class:***
```Java
public class SquareTest extends ConsoleProgram
{
     public void run()
     {
          Square ourSquare = new Square(10);
          
          /* `.getArea()` only exists in `Rectangle`, but we can use it
           * Since it is the parent class of `Square`
           */ 
          int squareArea = ourSquare.getArea();
     }
}
```
