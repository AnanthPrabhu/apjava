# Inheritance
<hr>

Inheritance is when we have two classes that share functionality. You use inheritance when you want to create a new class, but utilize existing code from another class. In this case, you derive your new class from the existing class. By doing this, you can utilize methods from the existing class without having to rewrite code.
