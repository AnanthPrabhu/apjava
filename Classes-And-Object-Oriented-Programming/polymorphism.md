# Polymorphism
<hr>
***Polymorphism*** is one of the most important concepts in Object Oriented Programming.
<br>
<br>
***Polymorphism*** is the capability of a single object to take on multiple forms. ***Polymorphism*** can also be explained as the ability to perform a single action in many ways across multiple objects. It also allows us to use the same method across different objects, using different implementations. 

### Polymorphism Concepts
<hr>
There are several concepts of ***polymorphism*** that are crucial to remember. These include:

- **Upcasting: ** Occurs when the reference variable of a super class refers to the object of the subclass. This allows us to go from a low level class type to a higher level one.

- **Downcasting: ** Occurs when the reference variable of a subclass refers to the object of the superclass. This allows us to go from a high level class type to a lower level one.

- **Dynamic Binding: ** The concept where the proper method implementation is chosen at run-time, and not compile-time.

- **Static Binding: ** The concept where the proper method implementation is chosen at compile-time, and not run-time.

- **Method Overriding: ** Allows us to call the correct implementation of a method across multiple objects that share the same superclass.
