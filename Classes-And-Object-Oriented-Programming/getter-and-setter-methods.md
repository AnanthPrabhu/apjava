# Getter and Setter Methods
<hr>
Getter and setter methods allow us to get and set instance variables from the client class. 


### Getter Methods
<hr>
***Getter methods*** allow us to access specific instance variables of an object. ***Getter methods*** are also known as ***accessor methods***.

##### Creating Getter Methods:
When creating ***getter methods*** there is a common convention you should follow. When naming your ***getter methods*** you should always use this format: `get[Variable Name]` for the name. Some examples of this would be: `getWidth();`, `getHeight()`, and `getColor()`. ***Getter methods*** usually only return the variable we are trying to get. Here are some examples of how this would look:

```Java
private int width = 10;
private int height = 3;
private Color rectCol = Color.blue;

public int getWidth()
{
     return width;
}

public int getHeight()
{
     return height;
}

public Color getColor()
{
    return rectCol;
}
```
