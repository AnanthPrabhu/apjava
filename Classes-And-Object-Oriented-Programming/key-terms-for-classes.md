# Key Terms for Classes

You've likely noticed that learning a programming language involves learning a lot of new vocabulary terms. LLet's review some of the key concepts and terms that we've learned so far.

## Objects and Classes

An **object** is something that contains both state and behavior. It is an instance of a class.

A **class** is a template for creating an object.

An **instance** is what you call a specific version of a class. Instances and objects generally refer to the same thing.

For example, if you owned a factory that produced bikes, you would likely want blueprints or plans for each type of bike. Mountain bikes would a blueprint, BMX bikes would have a different blueprint, and road bikes would have their own blueprint. These blueprints are like *classes* in programming. Each class can produce a specific object. If you were to follow the plans to build a road bike, the object you end up with could be called an **instance** of the "RoadBike" class.
