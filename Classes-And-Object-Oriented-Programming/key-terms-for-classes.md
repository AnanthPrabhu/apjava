# Key Terms for Classes

You've likely noticed that learning a programming language involves learning a lot of new vocabulary terms. LLet's review some of the key concepts and terms that we've learned so far.

## Objects and Classes

An **object** is something that contains both state and behavior. It is an instance of a class.

A **class** is a template for creating an object.

An **instance** is what you call a specific version of a class. Instances and objects generally refer to the same thing.

For example, if you owned a factory that produced bikes, you would likely want blueprints or plans for each type of bike. Mountain bikes would a blueprint, BMX bikes would have a different blueprint, and road bikes would have their own blueprint. These blueprints are like **classes** in programming. The plans for each class can produce a specific **object**. If you were to follow the plans to build a road bike, the object you end up with could be called an **instance** of the "RoadBike" class.

## State and Behavior

Objects have state and behavior. An object's state is store in variables, while its behavior is defined by methods. State and behavior can be specific to a single instance of a class (for example, one specific road bike), or shared between all the members of a class.

An **instance method** is a method called on an instance of a class, or an object, that helps define the behavior of the class.

An **instance variable** is a variable belonging to an instance of a class, or an object, that helps define the state of the class.

An **class method** or static method is a method called on the class. It does not have an object as the receiver. It is accessible to all instances of the class.

A **class variable** or static variable is a variable belonging to the class, not any object instance. It is accessible to all instances of the class.
